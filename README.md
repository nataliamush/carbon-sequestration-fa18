# carbon-sequestration-fa18
Data and notebooks for Data X Fall 2018 project on carbon sequestration. A writeup will be available at https://data-x.blog after the semester finishes.

Several Jupyter notebooks used by team members to explore and trial models - a summary of the entire learning path/thought process is available in final_notebook2.ipynb. (To instructors: our write-up annotates reasoning behind some processes in the notebook).
